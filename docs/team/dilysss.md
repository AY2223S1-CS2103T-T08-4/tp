### Project: SETA

SETA is a desktop tutorial management application used to help CS2103T TA's manage their tutorials and students. The
user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a student.
    * What it does: Allows the user to add in the name, email and telegram handle of a student.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can keep track of his or her
      students under him.
    * Highlights: This enhancement requires me to make changes to existing classes.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in
      the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

      semester.
