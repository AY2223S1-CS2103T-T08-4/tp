### Project: SETA

SETA is a desktop tutorial management application used to help CS2103T TA's to track their students’ and tutorials’ details, and questions asked by students. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
